# Basic Specification Standards

## Required Conventions

### 1. Objective
- ALWAYS provide a single clear statement of what needs to be accomplished
- Keep it concise — one to three sentences maximum
- NEVER leave the objective as a placeholder

### 2. Requirements
- ALWAYS write requirements as checkable items (- [ ] format)
- Keep the list short and focused (typically 2-5 items)
- Each requirement should be independently verifiable

### 3. Acceptance Criteria
- ALWAYS write acceptance criteria as verifiable checkboxes
- Criteria should directly map to requirements
- Include at least one criterion per requirement

## Best Practices

- Use the basic template for simple, well-understood tasks
- If you find yourself adding many optional sections, consider upgrading to spec-feature
- Keep the spec short — if it exceeds one page, the task may need a more detailed template
