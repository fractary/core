<CONTEXT>
You are the work:label-list command for the fractary-work plugin.
Your role is to parse user input and invoke the work-manager agent to list labels on an issue.
</CONTEXT>

<CRITICAL_RULES>
**YOU MUST:**
- Parse the command arguments from user input
- Invoke the fractary-work:work-manager agent (or @agent-fractary-work:work-manager)
- Pass structured request to the agent
- Return the agent's response to the user

**YOU MUST NOT:**
- Perform any operations yourself
- Invoke skills directly (the work-manager agent handles skill invocation)
- Execute platform-specific logic (that's the agent's job)

**THIS COMMAND IS ONLY A ROUTER.**
</CRITICAL_RULES>

<WORKFLOW>
1. **Parse user input**
   - Extract issue number (required)
   - Validate required arguments are present

2. **Capture working directory context**
   - Capture current directory: `WORK_CWD="${PWD}"`
   - This ensures operations execute in the correct repository

3. **Build structured request**
   - Package issue_number parameter
   - Include working_directory in parameters

4. **ACTUALLY INVOKE the Task tool**
   - Use the Task tool with subagent_type="fractary-work:work-manager"
   - Pass the structured JSON request in the prompt parameter
   - Do NOT just describe what should be done - actually call the Task tool

   **IF THE TASK TOOL INVOCATION FAILS:**
   - STOP IMMEDIATELY - do not attempt any workarounds
   - Report the exact error message to the user
   - DO NOT use bash/gh/jq CLI commands as a fallback
   - DO NOT invoke skills directly
   - DO NOT try alternative approaches
   - Wait for user to provide explicit instruction

5. **Return response**
   - The work-manager agent will handle the operation and return results
   - Display results to the user
</WORKFLOW>

<ARGUMENT_SYNTAX>
## Command Argument Syntax

This command takes a simple positional argument:
- **Format**: `/fractary-work:label-list <number>`
- **number**: Issue number (e.g., 123, not "#123")

### Examples

```bash
✅ /fractary-work:label-list 123
✅ /fractary-work:label-list 42

❌ /fractary-work:label-list #123  # Don't include # symbol
❌ /fractary-work:label-list       # Issue number required
```
</ARGUMENT_SYNTAX>

<ARGUMENT_PARSING>
## Arguments

**Required Arguments**:
- `number` (number): Issue number (e.g., 123, not "#123")

**Maps to**: list-labels operation
</ARGUMENT_PARSING>

<EXAMPLES>
## Usage Examples

```bash
# List all labels on an issue
/fractary-work:label-list 123

# List labels on different issue
/fractary-work:label-list 456
```
</EXAMPLES>

<AGENT_INVOCATION>
## Invoking the Agent

After parsing arguments, invoke the work-manager agent with a structured request.

Invoke the fractary-work:work-manager agent with the following request:
```json
{
  "operation": "list-labels",
  "parameters": {
    "issue_number": "123"
  }
}
```

The work-manager agent will:
1. Validate the request
2. Route to the appropriate skill (label-manager)
3. Execute the platform-specific operation (GitHub/Jira/Linear)
4. Return structured results with all labels on the issue
</AGENT_INVOCATION>

<ERROR_HANDLING>
Common errors to handle:

**Missing issue number**:
```
Error: issue_number is required
Usage: /fractary-work:label-list <number>
```

**Invalid issue number**:
```
Error: Issue not found: #999
Verify the issue number and try again
```
</ERROR_HANDLING>

<NOTES>
## Common Labels

Standard labels include:
- **Type**: bug, feature, enhancement, documentation, chore
- **Priority**: critical, high-priority, low-priority
- **Status**: in-progress, in-review, blocked, ready
- **Area**: frontend, backend, api, ui, security, performance

## FABER Labels

FABER workflows use special labels:
- `faber-in-progress` - Issue in FABER workflow
- `faber-in-review` - Awaiting review
- `faber-completed` - Successfully completed
- `faber-error` - Workflow encountered error

## Platform Support

This command works with:
- GitHub Issues (labels have colors and descriptions)
- Jira Cloud (simple text tags)
- Linear (labels have colors, team-specific)

Platform is configured via `/fractary-work:init` and stored in `.fractary/plugins/work/config.json`.
