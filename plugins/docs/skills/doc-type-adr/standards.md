# ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Documentation Standards

## Required Conventions

### 1. Structure
- ALWAYS include title, status, and date
- ALWAYS document context (why decision needed)
- ALWAYS list decision and rationale
- ALWAYS document consequences

### 2. Status
- ALWAYS specify status (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)
- ALWAYS link to superseding ADR if deprecated
- ALWAYS update status as decisions evolve
- ALWAYS maintain decision history

### 3. Alternatives
- ALWAYS list alternatives considered
- ALWAYS document why alternatives were rejected
- ALWAYS include trade-offs analysis
- ALWAYS reference supporting materials

### 4. Consequences
- ALWAYS document positive and negative consequences
- ALWAYS include implementation impact
- ALWAYS specify affected components
- ALWAYS track decision outcomes

## Best Practices

- Number ADRs sequentially (ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc.)
- Keep ADRs immutable (create new ADR to change decision)
- Link related ADRs
- Review ADRs periodically for relevance
- Use templates for consistency
