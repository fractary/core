- ALWAYS specify expected results
- ALWAYS document coverage requirements

### 2. Test Results
- ALWAYS record execution ID and timestamp
- ALWAYS include pass/fail summary with percentages
- ALWAYS document failures with error messages
- ALWAYS track coverage metrics

### 3. Validation Steps
- ALWAYS document pre-deployment validation
- ALWAYS include post-deployment validation
- ALWAYS specify data validation checks
- ALWAYS document rollback criteria

### 4. QA Process
- ALWAYS define quality gates
- ALWAYS include review checklist
- ALWAYS document acceptance criteria

## Best Practices
