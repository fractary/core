# Architecture Documentation Standards

## Required Conventions

### 1. Overview
- ALWAYS provide high-level system description
- ALWAYS include architecture diagrams
- ALWAYS document design principles
- ALWAYS specify quality attributes

### 2. Components
- ALWAYS document all system components
- ALWAYS describe component responsibilities
- ALWAYS show component interactions
- ALWAYS document technology choices

### 3. Decisions
- ALWAYS record architecture decisions (ADRs)
- ALWAYS include decision context and rationale
- ALWAYS document alternatives considered
- ALWAYS track consequences

### 4. Diagrams
- ALWAYS use consistent notation (C4, UML, etc.)
- ALWAYS include legend/key
- ALWAYS keep diagrams up to date
- ALWAYS version diagrams with code

## Best Practices

- Use layered documentation (system → container → component)
- Document cross-cutting concerns (security, logging, etc.)
- Maintain technology radar
- Link to detailed component documentation
- Keep architecture aligned with business goals
