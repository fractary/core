# Guides Documentation Standards

## Required Conventions

### 1. Clear Purpose
- ALWAYS state guide objective upfront
- ALWAYS define target audience
- ALWAYS specify prerequisites
- ALWAYS estimate completion time

### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions
- ALWAYS number steps sequentially
- ALWAYS include commands and code examples
- ALWAYS show expected outputs
- ALWAYS provide troubleshooting tips

### 3. Examples
- ALWAYS include working examples
- ALWAYS test examples before publishing
- ALWAYS use realistic scenarios
- ALWAYS explain example outputs

### 4. References
- ALWAYS link to related documentation
- ALWAYS reference API docs or SDKs
- ALWAYS include further reading
- ALWAYS keep links up to date

## Best Practices

- Use screenshots sparingly (prefer code examples)
- Include "What you'll learn" section
- Provide "Next steps" at the end
- Keep guides focused on single topic
- Update guides when features change
