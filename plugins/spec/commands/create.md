Create a specification from current conversation context.

This command uses the full conversation context as the primary source for generating a specification. Optionally enrich with GitHub issue data by providing `--work-id`.

**Key Features**:
- **Context Preservation**: Directly invokes the spec-generator skill to preserve conversation context, bypassing the agent layer
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects the current issue ID from your branch name (via repo plugin cache) if `--work-id` is not provided
- **Idempotent**: Safely skips creation if a spec already exists for the issue (use `--force` to override)

## Usage

```bash
/fractary-spec:create [options]
```

## Options

- `--work-id <id>`: Optional - Link to issue and enrich with issue data (description + all comments). If omitted, automatically detects issue ID from current branch name (e.g., `feat/123-description` → `123`)
- `--template <type>`: Optional - Override auto-detection (basic|feature|infrastructure|api|bug)
- `--prompt "<instructions>"`: Optional - Instructions for how to generate the spec from conversation context
- `--force`: Optional - Force creation of a new spec even if one already exists for the issue. Use this when requirements have evolved and you need a new spec.

## Idempotent Behavior

When a spec already exists for an issue, this command will:

1. **Detect existing specs** matching `WORK-{issue_id}-*.md` pattern
2. **Read the existing spec(s)** to load context into the session
3. **Skip creation** and return a "skipped" status
4. **Show hint** about using `--force` to create additional specs

This makes it safe to embed `/fractary-spec:create` in workflows without worrying about duplicate specs.

**Override with `--force`**:
When you intentionally need multiple specs (e.g., requirements have evolved), use `--force`:
```bash
/fractary-spec:create --work-id 123 --force
```
This creates an additional spec with a unique slug (timestamp-suffixed if needed).

## Auto-Detection Behavior

When `--work-id` is not provided:
1. Reads repo plugin's git status cache (`~/.fractary/repo/status-*.cache`)
2. Extracts `issue_id` from current branch name
3. If found, automatically uses it as `--work-id`
4. If not found, creates standalone spec with `SPEC-{timestamp}-*` naming

**Branch patterns supported** (via repo plugin):
- `feat/123-description` → issue #123
- `fix/456-bug-name` → issue #456
- `chore/789-task` → issue #789
- Any `{prefix}/{number}-{description}` pattern

## Examples

### Basic Usage (Context Only, No Branch Tie)

After a planning discussion in the current session (on `main` or non-issue branch):

```bash
/fractary-spec:create
```

Generates: `/specs/SPEC-20250115143000-<slug>.md`
- Uses full conversation context
- Auto-detects template from discussion
- No GitHub linking (no branch tie detected)
- Standalone specification

### Auto-Detected Work Item (On Issue Branch)

After refining approach while on branch `feat/123-user-auth`:

```bash
/fractary-spec:create
```

Generates: `/specs/WORK-00123-<slug>.md`
- Auto-detects issue #123 from branch name
- Uses conversation context as primary source
- Fetches issue #123 (description + all comments via repo plugin)
- Merges conversation + issue data
- Links to issue #123 (GitHub comment added)

**Note**: This is the recommended workflow - branch already indicates the issue, no need to specify `--work-id` manually.

### With Explicit Work Item (Context + Issue Enrichment)

After refining approach for issue #123:

```bash
/fractary-spec:create --work-id 123
```

Generates: `/specs/WORK-00123-<slug>.md`
- Uses conversation context as primary source
- Fetches issue #123 (description + all comments via repo plugin)
- Merges conversation + issue data
- Auto-detects template from merged context
- Links to issue #123 (GitHub comment added)

### With Template Override

Force specific template type:

```bash
/fractary-spec:create --template infrastructure --work-id 123
```

Generates: `/specs/WORK-00123-<slug>.md`
- Uses infrastructure template regardless of auto-detection
- Links to issue #123

### With Additional Instructions

Provide explicit instructions alongside conversation:

```bash
/fractary-spec:create --prompt "Focus on REST API design with OAuth2" --work-id 123
```

Generates: `/specs/WORK-00123-<slug>.md`
- Considers: conversation + explicit context + issue data
- Auto-detects or uses provided template

## What It Does

1. **Auto-Detect Work ID**: If `--work-id` not provided, reads repo plugin cache to detect issue ID from current branch
2. **Extract Conversation Context**: Uses full conversation history as primary source
3. **Fetch Issue (if work_id detected or provided)**: Gets issue description + all comments via repo plugin
4. **Merge Contexts**: Combines conversation + explicit context + issue data (if available)
5. **Auto-Detect Template**: Infers appropriate template from merged context
6. **Generate Spec**: Creates specification from merged context
7. **Save Local**: Writes to `/specs` directory
   - With work_id: `WORK-{id:05d}-{slug}.md`
   - Without: `SPEC-{timestamp}-{slug}.md`
8. **Link to Issue (if work_id present)**: Comments on GitHub with spec location

## Template Auto-Detection

Template is automatically inferred from context:

- **bug**: Keywords like "fix", "bug", "defect", "regression"
- **feature**: Keywords like "add", "implement", "new feature", "enhancement"
- **infrastructure**: Keywords like "deploy", "AWS", "Terraform", "infrastructure"
- **api**: Keywords like "API", "endpoint", "REST", "GraphQL"
- **basic**: Default fallback

No prompting required - the best template is selected automatically.

## Naming Convention

### With `--work-id`
Pattern: `WORK-{issue:05d}-{slug}.md`

Examples:
- `WORK-00123-user-authentication.md`
- `WORK-00084-api-redesign.md`

### Without `--work-id`
Pattern: `SPEC-{timestamp}-{slug}.md`

Examples:
- `SPEC-20250115143000-user-authentication.md`
- `SPEC-20250115150000-api-redesign.md`

Timestamp format: `YYYYMMDDHHmmss`

## Output

### Example: Context Only

```
🎯 STARTING: Spec Generator (Context Mode)
Template: feature (auto-detected)
───────────────────────────────────────

Analyzing conversation context...
Auto-detecting template: feature
Generating spec: SPEC-20250115143000-user-auth.md
Spec saved locally.

✅ COMPLETED: Spec Generator
Spec created: /specs/SPEC-20250115143000-user-auth.md
Template used: feature
Source: Conversation context
───────────────────────────────────────
Next: Begin implementation using spec as guide
```

### Example: Context + Issue Enrichment

```
🎯 STARTING: Spec Generator (Context Mode)
Work ID: #123
Template: feature (auto-detected)
───────────────────────────────────────

Analyzing conversation context...
Fetching issue #123 (with comments)...
Merging conversation + issue data...
Auto-detecting template: feature
Generating spec: WORK-00123-user-auth.md
Linking to issue #123...

✅ COMPLETED: Spec Generator
Spec created: /specs/WORK-00123-user-auth.md
Template used: feature
Source: Conversation + Issue #123
GitHub comment: ✓ Added
───────────────────────────────────────
Next: Begin implementation using spec as guide
```

## GitHub Integration

When `--work-id` is provided, a comment is added to the issue:

```markdown
📋 Specification Created

Specification generated for this issue:
- [WORK-00123-user-auth.md](/specs/WORK-00123-user-auth.md)

This spec will guide implementation and be validated before archival.
```

## Context Preservation

**Why this command bypasses the agent:**

Traditional flow:
```
Command → Agent → Skill
         └─ Context lost here (agent starts fresh conversation)
```

This command:
```
Command → Skill (direct)
         └─ Full conversation context preserved
```

This design ensures the specification captures the full planning discussion, not just the final command arguments.

## FABER Integration

In FABER workflow, you can configure which command to use in the Architect phase:

```toml
[workflow.architect]
generate_spec = true
spec_plugin = "fractary-spec"
spec_command = "create"  # Use context-centric command
```

## Use Cases

### Standalone Exploratory Specs
After a design discussion with no tied work item:
```bash
/fractary-spec:create --template feature
```
Results in standalone spec for reference.

### Work Item with Rich Context
After extensive planning for issue #123:
```bash
/fractary-spec:create --work-id 123
```
Captures both the planning discussion AND the issue details.

### Multi-Phase Planning
After discussing phase 1 of a complex feature:
```bash
/fractary-spec:create --work-id 123 --prompt "Phase 1: User Authentication"
```

### Force Creation (When Spec Exists)
When requirements have evolved and you need an additional spec:
```bash
/fractary-spec:create --work-id 123 --force
```
Creates: `/specs/WORK-00123-{new-slug}-{timestamp}.md`

### Re-running on Existing Issue (Idempotent)
Running the command twice on the same issue:
```bash
# First run - creates spec
/fractary-spec:create --work-id 123
# Output: Spec created: /specs/WORK-00123-feature-name.md

# Second run - skips creation
/fractary-spec:create --work-id 123
# Output: SKIPPED: Spec already exists
#         Existing spec: /specs/WORK-00123-feature-name.md
#         Hint: Use --force to create additional spec
```

## Recommended Workflow

**Best Practice**: Work on issue-tied branches and let auto-detection handle linking:

```bash
# 1. Create/checkout issue branch (via repo plugin or manually)
/fractary-repo:branch-create "implement feature" --work-id 123

# 2. Discuss and plan in Claude Code session
# ... conversation about approach, design, requirements ...

# 3. Create spec (auto-detects issue #123 from branch)
/fractary-spec:create

# Result: WORK-00123-implement-feature.md
# - Full conversation context captured
# - Issue data merged automatically
# - GitHub comment added to issue
```

**Override when needed**:
- Use `--work-id` explicitly if you want to link to a different issue
- Omit `--work-id` on issue branches if you want standalone specs

## Troubleshooting

**No slug generated**:
- Ensure conversation has meaningful content
- Use `--prompt` to provide explicit description
- Fallback: timestamp-based naming

**Template detection unclear**:
- Use `--template` to override
- Provide clearer keywords in discussion

**Issue not found** (when using `--work-id`):
- Check issue number is correct
- Ensure you have GitHub access
- Verify repository is correct

**Warning: GitHub comment failed**:
- Non-critical, spec still created
- Can manually link if needed

**Spec creation skipped unexpectedly**:
- A spec already exists for this issue
- View existing spec: check `/specs/WORK-{issue_id}-*.md`
- To create additional spec: use `--force` flag
- This is expected behavior (idempotent design)

**Force flag not creating unique filename**:
- Check if slugs are different (different context = different slug)
- If slugs collide, timestamp suffix is automatically added
- Example: `WORK-00123-feature-20251205180000.md`
